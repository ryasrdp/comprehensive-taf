### Title: Add "Purpose of Travel" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to specify the purpose of my travel in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can understand the reason for my journey and ensure proper documentation and approvals.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the purpose of the applicant's travel. Adding a **Purpose of Travel** field will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for verifying the intent of the journey and maintaining accurate records.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
3. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
4. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain valid characters."*
5. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Purpose of Travel** field, if provided.
