Estimation using Fibonacci Sequence (Story Points):

1.Add the "Employer City" field to the Employment Information section. It should be optional and contain a placeholder.
UI change, just adding an optional input with a placeholder.Quite easy
Story Points:2

2.Implement validation logic: on invalid input, display the message "Field must contain valid characters.
Implementing validation requires extra logic(functions) to check input and show error messages correctly.
Story Points:3

3.Ensure that the submitted Employer City value (if provided) is shown in the output table after submission.
Displaying the submitted data in the output table is more complex, involving data handling and UI updates.
Story Points:5

4.Write tests to cover UI rendering, validation, and data display logic.
Writing tests is essential for quality assurance but it is  complex.
Story Points:3

Total Estimation: 13 story points
