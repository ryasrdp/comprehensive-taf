**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide my employer's state or province in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can verify the regional location of my workplace and ensure accurate record-keeping.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the state or province where the employer is located. Adding an **Employer State/Province** field will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for verifying employment details and location.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.  
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Employment Information** section.  
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.  
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.  
5. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain valid characters."*  
6. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Employer State/Province** field, if provided.

## Story Points Estimation: 2

### Rationale:
- **Straightforward form field addition** following existing form structure  
- **Basic validation logic** using character whitelist  
- **Low implementation complexity** â€“ static visibility, not conditional  
- **UI/UX consistency** maintained with other Employment section fields  
- **Test coverage** easy to implement using standard test components

## Automation Limitations:  
Currently, tooltip-based validation error capture is limited for overlapping field names in dynamic sections. Manual validation testing is recommended for:  
- TC-006: Special characters and non-Latin symbols  
- TC-007: Emoji validation
