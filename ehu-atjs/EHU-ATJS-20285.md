### Title: Add "Major/Field of Study" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide my major or field of study in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can understand my academic specialization and evaluate my educational background.

### Description:

Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the applicant's major or field of study. Adding a **Major/Field of Study** field will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for verifying their academic focus and ensuring accurate record-keeping.

### Scenario:

1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Education Information** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. Validation errors shall display the message: _"Field must contain valid characters."_
6. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Major/Field of Study** field, if provided.

## Story Points Estimation: 2

### Rationale:

- **Straightforward form field addition** following existing form structure
- **Basic validation logic** using character whitelist
- **Low implementation complexity** â€“ static visibility, not conditional
- **UI/UX consistency** maintained with other Education section fields
- **Test coverage** easy to implement using standard test components
