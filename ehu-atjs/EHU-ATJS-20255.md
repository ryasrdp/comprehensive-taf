### Title: Add "Who did you collaborate with on planet Earth?" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide information about the individuals or groups I collaborated with on planet Earth  
**So that** authorities can understand the nature of my interactions and partnerships during my time on Earth.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field to capture information about collaborations on Earth. Adding a **Who did you collaborate with on planet Earth?** field will allow users to share details about the individuals, organizations, or entities they worked with, which is important for context and record-keeping.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Race Information** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. The field shall be a **multi-line text field** with a maximum length of 200 words.
6. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must not exceed 200 words."*
7. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Who did you collaborate with on planet Earth?** field, if provided.
