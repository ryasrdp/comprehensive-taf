### Title: Add "Current Employer" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide the name of my current employer in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can understand my professional affiliations and verify my employment details.

2. The field shall be displayed in the **Employment Information** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
