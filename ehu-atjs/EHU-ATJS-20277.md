### Title: Add "Associate's Degree" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide the name of my associate's degree in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can understand my educational background and qualifications.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the name of the applicant's associate's degree. Adding an **Associate's Degree** field will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for evaluating their educational credentials and ensuring accurate record-keeping.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Education Information** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain valid characters."*
6. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Associate's Degree** field, if provided.

### Pre-conditions:
- Access to the Petition for Space Travel form (https://ryasrdp.github.io/)
- Browser with JavaScript enabled

### Test Data:
- Valid degree names: "Computer Science", "Business Administration", "Liberal Arts"
- Edge cases: "A", "Engineering-Technology", "Arts & Sciences"
- Invalid characters: "Test@123", "Degree!@#", "<script>alert('test')</script>"
- Empty/blank value

### Test Steps:

#### TC-1: Field Presence and Location
1. Navigate to https://ryasrdp.github.io/
2. Locate the "Education Information" section
3. **Expected**: "Associate's Degree" field is present in the Education Information section
4. **Expected**: Field has appropriate placeholder text when empty

#### TC-2: Field Optionality
1. Navigate to the form
2. Fill all mandatory fields (First Name, Last Name, etc.)
3. Leave "Associate's Degree" field empty
4. Click "Submit" button
5. **Expected**: Form submits successfully without validation errors
6. **Expected**: Submitted data table shows other fields correctly

#### TC-3: Valid Data Entry
1. Navigate to the form
2. Enter "Computer Science" in Associate's Degree field
3. Fill all mandatory fields
4. Click "Submit" button
5. **Expected**: Form submits successfully
6. **Expected**: Output table shows "Computer Science" in Associate's Degree field

#### TC-4: Edge Case Values
1. Test with edge case values: "A", "Engineering-Technology", "Arts & Sciences"
2. For each value:
   - Enter value in Associate's Degree field
   - Fill mandatory fields and submit
   - **Expected**: Form accepts the value and displays it in output table

#### TC-5: Invalid Character Validation (if applicable)
1. Enter invalid characters in Associate's Degree field
2. Attempt to submit form
3. **Expected**: If validation is implemented, error message should display "Field must contain valid characters."

#### TC-6: Field Behavior
1. Click in Associate's Degree field
2. **Expected**: Field accepts keyboard input
3. **Expected**: Field allows copy/paste operations
4. **Expected**: Field supports typical text editing (backspace, delete, select all)

### Expected Results:
