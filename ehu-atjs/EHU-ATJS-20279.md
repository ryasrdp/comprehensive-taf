### Title: Add "High School Location" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide the location of my high school in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can verify my educational background and understand where I completed my secondary education.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the location of the applicant's high school. Adding a **High School Location** field will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for verifying their academic history and ensuring accurate record-keeping.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Education Information** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain valid characters."*
6. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **High School Location** field, if provided.
