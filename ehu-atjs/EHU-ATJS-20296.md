### Title: Add "Universe" Field to the Previous Travel Information Section in the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide the name of the universe I previously traveled to in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can document my intergalactic travel history and understand the scope of my past journeys.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the universe the applicant previously traveled to. Adding a **Universe** field to the **Previous Travel Information** section will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for maintaining accurate records of intergalactic travel.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the **Previous Travel Information** section of the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
3. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
4. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain valid characters."*
5. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Universe** field, if provided.
