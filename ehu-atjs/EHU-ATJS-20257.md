### Title: Add "Solar System" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide the name of my solar system in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can identify my origin and better understand my interstellar background.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the applicant's solar system. Adding a **Solar System** field will allow users to provide this critical information, which is important for context and record-keeping during the application process.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Travel Information** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain Latin letters only."*
6. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Solar System** field, if provided.
