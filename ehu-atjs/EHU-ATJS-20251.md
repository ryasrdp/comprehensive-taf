### Title: Add "Alternative Phone" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form
**As** a user,

**I want** to provide an alternative phone number in the Petition for Space Travel form 

**So that** I can ensure I can be contacted through multiple channels.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form allows users to provide a primary phone number, but there is no option for an alternative contact number. Adding an Alternative Phone field will allow users to provide a secondary phone number that can be used for communication in case the primary number is unavailable. This ensures better reliability and flexibility in the communication process.

Scenario:
1. A New Field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed on the Petition for Space Travel Form near `Phone Number` field.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty. 
5. After clicking the Submit button, the form must display the submitted data, including the Alternative Phone field, if provided.
