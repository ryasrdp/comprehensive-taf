### Title: Add "Planet" Field to the Travel Information Section in the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide the name of the planet I intend to travel to in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can understand my specific destination and ensure accurate travel planning and record-keeping.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the planet the applicant intends to travel to. Adding a **Planet** field to the **Travel Information** section will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for planning interstellar travel and ensuring accurate documentation.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the **Travel Information** section of the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
3. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
4. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain valid characters."*
5. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Planet** field, if provided.
