### Title: Add "Minor (if applicable)" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide my minor field of study in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can understand my additional academic focus and evaluate my educational background comprehensively.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the applicant's minor field of study. Adding a **Minor (if applicable)** field will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for verifying their academic focus beyond their major and ensuring accurate record-keeping.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Education Information** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain valid characters."*
6. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Minor (if applicable)** field, if provided.

## Story Points Estimation: 2

### Rationale:

- **Straightforward form field addition** following existing form structure
- **Basic validation logic** using character whitelist
- **Low implementation complexity** â€“ static visibility, not conditional
- **UI/UX consistency** maintained with other Education section fields
- **Test coverage** easy to implement using standard test components

## Automation Limitations:

Currently, tooltip-based validation error capture is limited for overlapping field names in dynamic sections. Manual validation testing is recommended for:

- TC-006: Non-Latin characters with symbols
- TC-007: Emoji validation
