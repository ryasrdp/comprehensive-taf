### Title: Add "Certifications & Licenses" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to list my certifications or licenses in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can evaluate my professional qualifications and ensure I meet the required standards for space travel.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying the applicant's certifications or licenses. Adding a **Certifications & Licenses** field will allow users to provide this information, which is essential for assessing their qualifications and ensuring accurate record-keeping.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Skills & Qualifications** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must contain valid characters."*
6. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **Certifications & Licenses** field, if provided.
