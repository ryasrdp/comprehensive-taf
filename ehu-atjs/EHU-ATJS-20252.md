### Title: Add "Emergency Contact Name" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide the name of an emergency contact in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can reach out to a designated person in case of an emergency during my space travel.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for specifying an emergency contact name. Adding an **Emergency Contact Name** field will allow users to provide the name of a trusted individual who can be contacted in case of an emergency. This ensures safety and preparedness during space travel.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed on the Petition for Space Travel Form near the **Emergency Contact Phone** field.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. After clicking the **Submit** button, the form must display the submitted data, including the **Emergency Contact Name** field, if provided.
