### Title: Add "What else would you like to tell us about yourself?" Field to the Petition for Space Travel Form

**As** a user,  
**I want** to provide additional information about myself in the Petition for Space Travel form  
**So that** authorities can gain deeper insights into my background, personality, or any unique circumstances relevant to my application.

### Description:
Currently, the Petition for Space Travel form does not include a field for applicants to share additional details about themselves. Adding a **What else would you like to tell us about yourself?** field will allow users to provide extra information that might not fit into other predefined sections, offering flexibility and personalization in the application process.

### Scenario:
1. A new field shall be added to the Petition for Space Travel Form.
2. The field shall be displayed in the **Race Information** section.
3. The field shall not be mandatory on UI.
4. The field must display its placeholder when empty.
5. The field shall be a **multi-line text field** with a maximum length of 200 words.
6. Validation errors shall display the message: *"Field must not exceed 200 words."*
7. After clicking the **Submit** button, the output table must display the submitted data, including the **What else would you like to tell us about yourself?** field, if provided.
